3. Double Bear

This is a game named “double bear” which used to be a sample gesture game like finger guessing game in developer’s childhood.

The main method to playing this game is to use the magic arts struck down rival to be the winner. The game allow at least 2 players and no more than 4 players to play in the past. The most three basic magic is “gas”, “shield” and “baozi”.

First magic “gas”, it is similar with energy value. Each round allow each players to use one magic and if you use this one, it will give you one gas and you can use the gas like energy in the future confrontation. With the consume of the gas, you can use lot of attack magic like “baozi”. Make sure that your rival didn’t use attack magic like “baozi” when you are using “gas”, it will shut down your life! Every attack magic will kill you if you use “gas” to withstand. So, use it cautious and caredully. It can be sure that the first magic of each person must be “gas” because each attack need gas to display and in the first round, both of players have no gas.
Secondly, shield. It can protect you from the “baozi”. It won’t need gas and it might be the most common magic in basic playing method.

Third, baozi. It named from a Chinese traditional food “baozi”. It likes dumplings but bigger, it will cost one gas for each time using. Every time when you use baozi and your rival use gas, he lost the game. But if you have no more than one gas and you use baozi, you will lost the game because of lack of gas. In this turn, even if he use gas, he will win the game.
More information may from the developer.
